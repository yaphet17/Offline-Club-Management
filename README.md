# Offline-Club-Management
## Description
It is an offline desktop application that used to manage a small club.I created this application fjava or our university csec-development club and i took me one day to finish it.
## Language and Libraries
I used a Java programming language to create the app, [Javafx](https://openjfx.io/) for UI, MySQL for database  and [Spring security](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/html5) library to encrypt login credentials.
## User guide
 - First download all files from my github
 - If you use IDE rather than Netbeans javafx 
needs further configuration(so configure javafx in your IDE).
 - Create a database called icpc_club_management and import icpc_club_management.sql file to your database.
 - Modify datbaseConnection.java according to your database configuration.
